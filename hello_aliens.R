cat("Hello Extraterrestrials,
My name is Toshitha and I am a human from Earth found in the Milkway Galaxy. 
We are very excited to have found other living beings in this vast universe and would love to begin a relationship with your kind. 

Just a little bit about us, we are fairly harmless creatures that are curious as can be seen by our inquisition of other worlds.
We are carbon based creatures that survive by breathing oxygen, drinking water (H2O), and consuming food for energy. 

How do your bodies function and what kind of environment is the planet that you live on?

Earth is mostly made of large bodies of water, with 7 major continents (areas of land). For the most part, humans live on this land as we cannot sustain in the water for long periods of time.

Thanks for reading my message and we would love to hear a reply from you guys. 

Sincerely,
Toshitha
